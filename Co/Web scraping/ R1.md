Creating an advanced web scraping tool with a wide range of features can be quite complex, but I can guide you through building a versatile web scraper using Python and some popular libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium. Here's a step-by-step outline to get you started:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
First, you'll need to install the necessary libraries. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 scrapy selenium
```

### Step 2: Basic Structure
Create a basic structure for your scraper. Here's a simple example using BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def fetch_page(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.text
    else:
        return None

def parse_html(html):
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
    return soup

def main():
    url = 'https://example.com'
    html = fetch_page(url)
    if html:
        soup = parse_html(html)
        # Add your scraping logic here
        print(soup.prettify())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Step 3: Adding Features

#### Price Monitoring
To monitor prices, you can target specific elements on e-commerce websites:

```python
def extract_price(soup):
    price = soup.find('span', {'class': 'price'}).text
    return price
```

#### News and Articles
For scraping news articles, you can target the article tags:

```python
def extract_articles(soup):
    articles = soup.find_all('article')
    for article in articles:
        title = article.find('h2').text
        content = article.find('p').text
        print(f'Title: {title}\nContent: {content}\n')
```

#### Finding Person Information
For finding person information, you might need to scrape social media or directory sites:

```python
def extract_person_info(soup):
    names = soup.find_all('div', {'class': 'name'})
    for name in names:
        print(name.text)
```

#### Email Scraping
To scrape emails, you can use regex:

```python
import re

def extract_emails(soup):
    emails = re.findall(r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b', str(soup))
    return emails
```

#### Statement Scraping
For scraping statements or quotes:

```python
def extract_statements(soup):
    statements = soup.find_all('blockquote')
    for statement in statements:
        print(statement.text)
```

### Step 4: Using Selenium for Dynamic Content
For websites that load content dynamically with JavaScript, you can use Selenium:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

def fetch_dynamic_page(url):
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()))
    driver.get(url)
    html = driver.page_source
    driver.quit()
    return html
```

### Step 5: Putting It All Together
Combine all these features into a single tool:

```python
def main():
    url = 'https://example.com'
    html = fetch_page(url)
    if html:
        soup = parse_html(html)
        print('Prices:')
        print(extract_price(soup))
        print('Articles:')
        extract_articles(soup)
        print('Person Information:')
        extract_person_info(soup)
        print('Emails:')
        print(extract_emails(soup))
        print('Statements:')
        extract_statements(soup)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Additional Tips
- **Respect website terms of service**: Always check the website's `robots.txt` file and terms of service to ensure you're allowed to scrape the site.
- **Handle exceptions**: Add error handling to manage issues like network errors or changes in website structure.
- **Use proxies and user agents**: To avoid getting blocked, use rotating proxies and user-agent strings.

This should give you a solid foundation to build upon. Feel free to expand and customize the tool based on your specific needs! If you have any questions or need further assistance, just let me know.
